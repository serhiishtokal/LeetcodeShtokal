# Valid Anagram

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an **anagram** of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

- Example 1:

    ```
    Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: true
    ```

- Example 2:

    ```
    Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: false
    ```

## Constraints

- $$1 \leq s.length, t.length \leq 5 \times 10^4$$
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Follow up

What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
